Any todo will be marked by my name, Raja. Search for it.

As of 1.17.5 of Vault, lets check all Auth and Secret backends for consumer operations

Auth Methods

1. AliCloud

Login is good.
Admin is also good.

Investigated the Gist to get CallerIdentityRequestUrl and Headers.
It is a good little problem as the code is hidden deep inside the AliCloud C# SDK Tea Core DLL classes.
Maybe very tricky to intercept. We need to capture the HttpRequestMessage. It is gold. But hidden.
Maybe a dummy proxy way? Go library seem to give a capture mechanism. Anyways, weekend problem. Raja

2. AppRole : good
3. AWS : login is good
4. Azure: Resource Id was missing in login. Added. >> good now.
5. Cloud Foundry: login is good. Gist is also there.
6. Github: login is good
7. Google Cloud: login is good. Probably needs a helper gist to get the JWT. Raja
8. OIDC/JWT: login is good
9. Kerberos: login is good. Gist is also there. Needs login extension for sp-nego-toekn input. Raja
10. Kubernetes: login is good. Probably needs a helper gist to get the JWT. Raja
11. LDAP: login is good
12. OCI: login is good. Probably needs a helper gist to get the signed request headers. Raja
13. Okta: login is good
14. Radius: login is good
15. SAML: Login is missing. So add it. Enterprise.SAML. Seems to be a weird 2-3 step flow. Understand. Raja
16. TLS Cert: login is good
17. Tokens: check this cleanly for every method. Raja
18. Username & Password: login is good.

Secret Backends

Mainly the credential generating apis.
Everything seems to be there. Cool.

------

Every detail. Not necessary to implement, but read. Raja.
